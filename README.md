## Description
This repository contains the solutions for ADM-HW3. Here's an overview of the contents:

- **final_adm3_notebook.ipynb:** This notebook includes all the answers to the homework questions.
- **crawler.py,  parser.py** These scripts contain the functions used in 1. Data collection
- **functions.py, search_engine_2.py** These scripts contain the functions used in 2. Search Engine, 3. Define a new score!, 4. Visualizing the most relevant MSc degrees
- **vocabulary.pkl, new_inverted_index.pkl, inverted_index.pkl** These files are used in the Search Engine. 
- **CommandLine.sh** This file contains the commands for 6. Command Line Question (CLQ)

  
## Take Note
**vocabulary.pkl, new_inverted_index.pkl, inverted_index.pkl** have been computed during the offline part of 2. Search Engine and stored in different files as suggested in the text assignement. We need to load them in the online part of the same excersise, that's why we put them in the github repository.
